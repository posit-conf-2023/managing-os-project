    "text": "Workshop overview\nüóìÔ∏è September 17, 2023\n‚è∞ 09:00 - 17:00\nüè® TBA\n‚úçÔ∏è Click here to register\nAn open source project starts with ideas and code, but it continues with people. We know that most open source projects rely on just one or two people for most of the work. And code is just a small part of these roles, which also include project management, conflict resolution, decision making in uncertain situations, building an inclusive community, and lots and lots of communication. Whether you‚Äôre just starting a project, interested in getting involved in open source, or already have a community of thousands, there are some tips, tricks and templates that you can use to make maintaining an open source project more manageable.\nIn this interactive 1-day workshop you‚Äôll learn some key practices for effect open source project management. You‚Äôll walk away with new approaches for making project decisions, better strategies to manage user and contributor interactions, and better ways to set boundaries. Different projects make different decisions based on their needs and in this workshop you‚Äôll see what types of decisions are possible, and how you can make the ones appropriate for you. During the workshop, you‚Äôll create useful documents for your repository and begin to outline some processes you can finalize later or with your team.\nThis workshop is for you if you:\nThe workshop will include four modules:\nThroughout each module we‚Äôll have a general presentation and discussion of the topic, and then hands-on time for you to consider your own project, and to start to create some of the documentation or resources you need.\nNo pre-work is required for this workshop, but part of the workshop will be asking you to consider some questions for your own project. So, you should be familiar with at least one open source project, and have reviewed the types of non-code issues or challenges you‚Äôre seeing with the project currently.\nYou should plan to bring your laptop to the workshop, so you can review or look up things about your open source project. We will be writing some documentation, and a familiarity with GitHub and markdown syntax is assumed.\nWe will also be using pen and paper! These will be provided at the workshop, but if you have a favorite brainstorming pen or pencil, please bring it along."

    "text": "Project Goals questions\n\nThe numbers\nLet‚Äôs start with an overview of your project.\n\nProject name:\nOnline resources: github repo, web site, etc\nHow long has your project been around?\nAbout how many people use your project?\nAbout how many contributors do you have? (however you define contributors)\nAbout how many core project members do you have? (however you define that)\nWhat stage would you describe your project? experimental, stable, sunsetting, something else?\nWhat are you most proud of about this project (ok, this isn‚Äôt a number)?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExercise\n\n\n\nAnswer these questions for your project. Pair up with someone else in the workshop and go talk through your responses with each other.\n\n\n\n\nStart with why.\nYou started or got involved in this project to solve some problem for yourself or others. Why are you involved in this project, who is that person you‚Äôre trying to help? It‚Äôs fine if this person is current, present or future you!\n\n\nYour envisioned users\nDescribe one or two types of people you envision your project serving\n\nWhat field(s) do they work or are living/working in that are relevant for your project?\nWhen are they using your project? As a part of their work, their hobby, or managing their lives?\nWhat tasks are they struggling with that your project addresses?\nWhat are they trying to achieve in their work/life that‚Äôs relevant for your project?\nAre there any restrictions on how they can use your project? e.g.¬†control on installation, access to data, etc.\nHow much time do they have for this work?\nIs this a core part of what they‚Äôre trying to do, or something that‚Äôs necessary, but not where they want to spend their time?\nWhat‚Äôs their level of programming/data science experience?\nWhat other limitations or features are you trying to address for your users with your project?\nWhat other questions did you think of about your users that you‚Äôd like to answer?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExercise\n\n\n\nAnswer these questions for your project. Pair up with someone else in the workshop. What‚Äôs one thing you realized about who you‚Äôre trying to serve with your project, going through these questions?\nTiming: 20 minutes answering questions, 10 minutes discussing\n\n\n\n\nAnd onto how many\nNow that you‚Äôve thought about an individual user or two, now let‚Äôs consider how many people you‚Äôd like your project to be able to serve, what community.\nConsidering your target users from above, how many people are in this category, where are they, and what percent of a field or community do they represent?\nAgain, this is about your goals, not necessarily where you are now.\n\nHow many people does your target user(s) represent (in orders of magnitude)?\nAre they easily identified and reached?\nWhat percent of a field do they represent?\nWhat does success look like for you? What percent of these people using your project is success?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExercise\n\n\n\nAnswer these questions for your project. Pair up with someone else in the workshop. What‚Äôs one thing you realized about the community you‚Äôre trying to reach in answering these questions?\nTiming: 15 minutes answering questions, 5 minutes discussing\n\n\n\n\nYou and your team\nOK, so you‚Äôve thought about the people and problems you want to serve with your project. But it‚Äôs just you and your team! Maybe your team is just you. So, what‚Äôs important to you and your team, about the time you have and how you work best.\n\nHow many people would you consider to be core members of this project and who are they? (How you define this is up to you)\nHow much time do they have to work on this project, and is a part of work or outside-of-work time, or a mix, where that time would be sustainable? Be realistic!\nAre any of the team members paid to work on this project?\nWhat parts of the project do you like working on best?\nWhat parts of the project worry you the most?\nOn your team (if you have one), who likes to do what, and/or is good at different areas, on the project? (Not who does what, but who likes and/or is good at the different project aspects)\nWhat do you see as some gaps, i.e.¬†‚Äòthis work isn‚Äôt anyone on the team‚Äôs current area of strength‚Äô.\nWhat personally is success for you and your relationship with this project? Complete this sentence. In one year, I will be happy if I am spending X amount of time on this project, am excited about Y and not worried about Z.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExercise\n\n\n\nAnswer these questions for your project. Pair up with someone else in the workshop. Share with them your response to the last question (what does success look like for you).\nTiming: 15 minutes answering questions, 5 minutes discussing\n\n\n\n\nContributors\nNow that you‚Äôve thought about who you want to serve with your project, and what‚Äôs important for you and your team, the other piece of the project is contributors. What are your goals here? How do you see that people can best contribute?\n\nWhat‚Äôs an example of a contribution to your project that you really appreciated?\nWhat is an example of a contribution that was difficult to handle?\nDo you like to work through github, Slack, in person meetings or other channels?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExercise\n\n\n\nAnswer these questions for your project. We‚Äôll use the responses in future sections."

If you don‚Äôt have special needs for your project, the MIT License is likely a good choice, and the standard GitHub Code of Conduct. Remember to identify a reporting process for your Code of Conduct. That‚Äôs a key component, just having the file is not enough.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExercise\n\n\n\nCheck your project for license and Code of Conduct files in your repository. Are they there?\nIn your Code of Conduct do you have:\n\ncontact information\ninformation on who receives an email/report\nfor the people who receive a report, do they have an idea of how to handle a report?\n\nIf after looking through this information, you‚Äôd like to learn more about Codes of Conduct, this is a good resource.\n\n\nWhile there are people who will mainly use your project, and not engage with the code, there‚Äôs a spectrum of users to contributors, not clear categories. In open source, most contributors are also users of the software. That‚Äôs why they want to contribute!\nFor this module we‚Äôre going to focus on people who engage with the project through wherever you have the code for the project through issues and PRs.\nWhen people share issues or PRs they usually have some expectation for a response. In the absense of information from the project on what that will be, people have a lot of their own ideas they bring to the interaction. Note, again, even if you write all of this down, people might not see it. But writing it down gives you something to point to, to respond. So, you‚Äôve articulated your goals for the project and your team. How should people share with you, and what can they expect as a response?\nSometimes this information is in a CONTRIBUTING.md file, but you might have it in a README or somewhere else.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExercise\n\n\n\nFill out this template for a CONTRIBUTING.md file for your project.\nCONTRIBUTING.md template\n\n\nYou may have noticed in the CONTIBUTING file, we said that the guidelines were for people who are new contributors. That‚Äôs because your project likely has different categories of contributors.\nThe tidyverse has a pull request guide that outlines three different types of contributors. For people in other modes of collaboration on your project, you should still be clear about the expectations for submission and review, but you likely want to address those differently than for someone who is submitting one or two issues/PRs to your project.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExercise\n\n\n\nLook at the .. section in the tidyverse PR guide. What types of collaboration do you have currently in your project? How might you adjust expectations for your project in the ‚Äò‚Ä¶‚Äô mode, versus how the tidyverse guide does."
