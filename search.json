We know that most open source projects rely on just one or two people for most of the work. And code is just a small part of these roles, which also include project management, conflict resolution, decision making in uncertain situations, building an inclusive community, and lots and lots of communication. Whether you‚Äôre just starting a project, interested in getting involved in open source, or already have a community of thousands, there are some tips, tricks and templates that you can use to make maintaining an open source project more manageable.\nIn this interactive 1-day workshop you‚Äôll learn some key practices for effect open source project management. You‚Äôll walk away with new approaches for making project decisions, better strategies to manage user and contributor interactions, and better ways to set boundaries. Different projects make different decisions based on their needs and in this workshop you‚Äôll see what types of decisions are possible, and how you can make the ones appropriate for you. During the workshop, you‚Äôll create useful documents for your repository and begin to outline some processes you can finalize later or with your team.\nThis workshop is for you if you:\nThe workshop will include four modules:\nThroughout each module we‚Äôll have a general presentation and discussion of the topic, and then hands-on time for you to consider your own project, and to start to create some of the documentation or resources you need.\nNo pre-work is required for this workshop, but part of the workshop will be asking you to consider some questions for your own project. So, you should be familiar with at least one open source project, and have reviewed the types of non-code issues or challenges you‚Äôre seeing with the project currently.\nYou should plan to bring your laptop to the workshop, so you can review or look up things about your open source project. We will be writing some documentation, and a familiarity with GitHub and markdown syntax is assumed.\nWe will also be using pen and paper! These will be provided at the workshop, but if you have a favorite brainstorming pen or pencil, please bring it along."

If you don‚Äôt have special needs for your project, the MIT License is likely a good choice, and the standard GitHub Code of Conduct. Remember to identify a reporting process for your Code of Conduct. That‚Äôs a key component, just having the file is not enough.\nThere are two main categories of people who will engage with your project - contributors (people who are contributing code, documentation or issues to the project) and users (people who primarily are using the code for their own projects). We‚Äôll consider both categories and how to set and manage expectations for each group."
